# Description: A writeup reflecting on the assignment.

(1) Anything positive you enjoyed or learned from this assignment
We enjoyed learning how to implement the perceptron training algorithm and understanding how it classifies the data that we were given.

(2) Anything negative you didn't like about this assignment
- Nothing

(3) Any parts of this assignment you found easy
- None
(4) Any parts of this assignment you found challenging or couldn't get working correctly
It was challenging for us to write the perceptron algorithm. At first we had implemented a stochastic gradient descent and thought that was the correct approach
but after further analysis and review of the project we found that we were meant to implement the perceptron training rule algorithm, so we needed to 
go back and restructure the code.

(5) How the team functioned:
 The team functioned by communicating through GroupMe and meeting several times a week. Regular Zoom meetings were held to brainstorm and design
the code and to review the progress. We split the work among us evenly.

What each team member contributed:

Our group worked by assigning different parts to different group members and getting together to review and debug. Ali and Corbin designed pseudocode and
structured the design of the class. Lana and Michael implemented the training algorithm for the perceptron. Corbin worked on the matplotlib for graphing the
epochs and errors. We all met up and worked together to evaluate and test all tasks. We all contributed to the write-ups and the README and all met up 
multiple times to brainstorm, debug, document and analyze the code.

How the team communicated with each other:
 -GroupMe was used for immediate communication and to decide when Zoom meetings would be held.
 -Zoom was used for longer meetings and to discuss the current state of the project and how to progress.

How team software development & design was accomplished
- During the first Zoom meeting, we were all prepared to brainstorm and discuss how we wanted to implement this project. In addition, we assigned parts of
the design we wanted each group member to work on. As for software development, a group member would finish their task and commit it to GitHub.
the team would come together to evaluate the code.

(6) Any other remarks you want to make
None
